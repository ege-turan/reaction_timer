# Reaction-Timer-2.0

This is a reaction timer designed to run on a Terasic DE10-Lite board. It features two separate reaction time tests and is programmed in verilog. The first test is active when SW9 is set to 0, and in this test the user presses KEY0 which triggers a random delay before activating all 10 LEDs as well as a timer which is accurate to the millisecond. Pressing KEY0 again will deactivate the LEDs and pause the timer to display the user's reaction time. The second test is active when SW9 is set to 1, and in this test the user presses KEY1 which triggers a 1.5 second delay before activating two random LEDs and starting the timer. The user must activate the switches beneath the active LEDs in order to stop the timer. Both tests also have their own high score register which will save the best time from each test which can be viewed by activating SW8. The project also features four timer resets which are triggered at the start of both tests and when the mode switch (SW9) is changed so that the displayed time from one test can't display in the other.
